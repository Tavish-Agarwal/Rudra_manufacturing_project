# Rudra_manufacturing_project

The first upload of file 
one.py contains all core classes created once. They havent been checked for consistency or attributes yet. But should be complete in theory.
molds_class_complete.py contains molds class that has been tested with test cases and work as intended. Only make changes here if you are adding fundamentally something. Otherwise its cohesive and complete.
testing_1.py contains method to create spider.csv
testing_2.py has the test cases which was used to verify and come up with molds_class_complete.py
